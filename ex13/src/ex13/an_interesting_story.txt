Long long ago, there was a kind girl living in a small village. 
Her family was very poor but the girl was happy and she was friendly to everyone.
One day, she met a frog on her way home. 
The frog was ill and it would die soon. 
The girl took the frog home and looked after it until the frog got stronger and stronger.
Very soon, the frog grew very very big. So the girl had to build a house for the frog. 
After a few days, the house was built and it was beautiful. 
The frog was very happy. 
The girl and the frog lived happily together.
But one evening, a robber went into the girl¡¯s house and he wanted to kill the girl. 
When the frog knew it, it was very angry. It jumped onto the girl¡¯s bed and woke her up. 
The girl wasn¡¯t afraid of the robber. 
She shouted and when her neighbours heard it, they ran into the girl¡¯s house and drove the robber away. 
The girl was thankful to the frog for saving her.
